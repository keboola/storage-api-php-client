# Storage API
Storage API provides an interface for sending data to Keboola Connection (KBC). The following are the most 
important features of the API:
- Importing CSV data into Table Storage
- Exporting CSV data from Table Storage
- Loading arbitrary files into File Storage
- Managing tables including keys and indexes
- Managing buckets including sharing
- Managing component configurations

The CSV files interchanged with Storage must adhere to the 
[RFC4180 Specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) and must use the `UTF-8` encoding.
The files can be sent uncompressed or gzipped. You can find more information about working 
with these files in [our manual](https://help.keboola.com/storage/tables/csv-files/).

For a list of available clients and their features, see the 
[Developers Documentation](https://developers.keboola.com/integrate/storage/).
In it you will also find more complex examples of 
[working with the API](https://developers.keboola.com/integrate/storage/api/).
This documentation assumes that you are already familiar with the
[Keboola Connection Storage component](https://help.keboola.com/storage/). 

## HTTP Response Codes
The response from Storage API will have an 
[HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) that will help 
you determine if the request was successful. In case of an error, the HTTP status code 
will help you determine the cause of the error. The status codes used by Storage API are
listed in the below tables.

### Success responses

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>200 <code>OK</code></td>
        <td>The request was successful.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>201 <code>Created</code></td>
        <td>The request was successful and a new resource was created.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>202 <code>Accepted</code></td>
        <td>Used for <a href='#introduction/synchronous-and-asynchronous-calls'>Asynchronous tasks</a>. A job resource is returned. The actual result must be obtained in another API call.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>204 <code>No Content</code></td>
        <td>The request was successful but there is nothing to return. Usually used as a response of DELETE requests.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Error responses
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>400 <code>Bad Request</code></td>
        <td>The request was invalid. Usually caused by invalid input data (missing arguments, invalid arguments values, etc.). The cause of the error is described in the response.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>401 <code>Unauthorized</code></td>
        <td>Authentication failed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>403 <code>Forbidden</code></td>
        <td>You don't have access to the resource.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>404 <code>Not Found</code></td>
        <td>You're asking for something that doesn't exist.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>500 <code>Internal Server Error</code></td>
        <td>Something went wrong. We are sorry, it is our fault and we will make our best to fix it! Feel free to <a href='mailto:suppor@keboola.com'>send us a ticket.</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>503 <code>Temporary Unavailable</code></td>
        <td>This response is typically returned when the system is under maintenance.
            The maintenance reason and expected maintenance end time are also returned in the response.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>


## Authentication
Authentication is done via Storage API **Token**. There are multiple options
for [obtaining a Storage API Token](https://help.keboola.com/storage/tokens/). 
The token must be sent as a value of the `X-StorageApi-Token` HTTP header with each API call.

Most API calls work within a *KBC Project*. The project is always derived from the token used for the API call.
So the token includes both authentication and authorization to a single project.

## Synchronous and Asynchronous Calls
Calls that represent potentially long-running actions are performed asynchronously. 
These are for example: loading table data, snapshotting, exporting table data, table structure modifications, etc.
All asynchronous calls return the HTTP Response code `202` and a [Job Resource](#reference/jobs). 
To obtain the actual result of the call, you have to monitor the job status by 
[polling the Job Resource URL](https://developers.keboola.com/integrate/storage/api/import-export/#python-example).

## Partial Response
Some API calls that list objects are returning related resources by default. For example, 
the [table list](#reference/tables/create-or-list-tables/tables-in-bucket) also returns
the table bucket properties and table attributes. You can use the `include` parameter 
to return only the required resources in the response.

# Group Maintenance

## Maintenance Response Example [/v2/storage/]

### Example [GET]
In case the system, or a project is under maintenance, you will receive a response similar to the below one. 
Maintenance typically applies to a single project, for example due to migration. Be sure to use the `Retry-After` header 
when accessing the API programatically.

+ Request
    + Headers

            X-StorageApi-Token: your_token

+ Response 503
    + Headers

            Content-type: application/json
            Retry-After: 559

    + Body

            {
                "status":"maintenance",
                "estimatedEndTime":"2013-05-25T10:30:44+02:00",
                "reason":"Thesystemisdownformaintenance",
            }


# Group Tokens and Permissions
When joining a project, each project administrator is assigned a [*master* token](https://help.keboola.com/storage/tokens/),
which enables them to create other tokens with limited privileges for buckets and components.

# Group Tables

## Create or List Tables [/v2/storage/buckets/{bucket_id}/tables]

### Create new table from CSV file [POST]

Creates a new table in a bucket. The CSV file must follow the [RFC 4180 Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180).
More information about the requirements can be found in the [Manual](https://help.keboola.com/storage/tables/csv-files/). 
Column names are extracted from the CSV file header; spaces and any other special characters in column names are
replaced with an underscore. This API call should be used only for tables which can be safely transferred in a single HTTP request; for large
tables use the [asynchronous call](#reference/tables/create-table-asynchronously/create-new-table-from-csv-file-asynchronously).

+ Parameters
    + bucket_id (required) - Bucket Id
    
+ Attributes    
    + name (required) - New table name
    + data (required) - CSV file containing data for import. The data have to be encoded in **UTF-8**. The file can be raw or gzipped. Gzipped files must have the extension `.gz`.
    + delimiter (optional) - Field delimiter used in the CSV file. The default value is ','.  Use '\t' or type the char for the tabulator.
    + enclosure (optional) - Field enclosure used in the CSV file. The default value is '"'. (Note: you can specify either `enclosure` or `escapedBy` parameter, not both.)
    + escapedBy (optional) - Escape character used in the CSV file. The default value is an empty value - no escape character is used. (Note: you can specify either `enclosure` or `escapedBy` parameter, not both.)
    + primaryKey (optional) - Primary key of the table. If the primary key is set, updates can be done on the table. See the CSV incremental import. The primary key can be also composed by multiple columns; the columns must be separated by a comma. For a table on the MySQL backend, the maximum number of the primary key columns is 4.

## Create Table Asynchronously [/v2/storage/buckets/{bucket_id}/tables-async]

### Create new table from CSV file asynchronously [POST]

The method of creating a table asynchronously should be used for larger imports (everything with 100 lines and more).
The create request is created and added to a queue, the job resource url for status polling is returned.
The actual data must be provided in one of the following attributes: 

- `dataUrl`,
- `dataFileId`,
- `snapshotId`,
- `dataWorkspaceId` and `dataTableName`

+ Parameters
    + bucket_id (required) - The bucket Id
    
+ Attributes    
    + name (required) - New table name
    + dataUrl (optional) - Publicly accessible url with a CSV file to import
    + dataFileId (optional) - Id of the file stored in [File Uploads](#reference/files)
    + snapshotId (optional) - Id of a table snapshot - a table will be created from the snapshot.
    + dataWorkspaceId (optional) - Load from the table [workspace](#reference/workspaces). Use with the **dataTableName** attribute.
    + dataTableName (optional) - Load from a table in [workspace](#reference/workspaces).
    + delimiter (optional) - Field delimiter used in the CSV file. The default value is ','.  Use '\t' or type the tab char for the tabulator.
    + enclosure (optional) - Field enclosure used in the CSV file. The default value is '"'. (Note: you can specify either the `enclosure` or `escapedBy` parameter, not both.)
    + escapedBy (optional) - Escape character used in the CSV file. The default value is an empty value - no escape character is used. (Note: you can specify either the `enclosure` or `escapedBy` parameter, not both.)
    + primaryKey (optional) - Primary key of a table. If the primary key is set, updates can be done on the table. See CSV incremental import. The primary key can be also composed by multiple columns; the columns must be separated by a comma. For a table on the MySQL backend, the maximum number of primary key columns is 4.

## Load Data [/v2/storage/tables/{table_id}/import]

### Load data from csv file to prepared table [POST]

 **This method of import is DEPRECATED**, please use [asynchronous import](#reference/tables/load-data-asynchronously).

 Each CSV table should contain a header with column names; all columns present in the table must be also present in the CSV file, new columns not present in the table are created. One of the `data`, `dataString` and `dataUrl` attributes must be provided.
 The CSV file can be raw or gzipped. Gzipped files must have the extension .gz.

+ Attributes
    + data (optional) - Multipart CSV file upload
    + dataString (optional) - CSV as a string in the request body
    + dataUrl (optional) - URL with a CSV file 
    + incremental (optional) - If incremental is set to 0, the target table is truncated before each import. Default is 0.
    + delimiter (optional) - Field delimiter used in the CSV file. The default value is ','.  Use '\t' or type the tab char for the tabulator.
    + enclosure (optional) - Field enclosure used in the CSV file. The default value is '"'.
    + partial (optional, boolean) **DEPRECATED - This parameter will be removed in the future version.** If partial is set to 1, only some of the table columns can be imported. It is useful for column updates. Supported only by the MySQL backend.
    + columns[] (optional) - List of columns present in the CSV file; the first line of the file will not be treated as a header!
    + withoutHeaders (optional, boolean) - The CSV file doesn't contain headers, columns are matched by their order.

## Load data asynchronously [/v2/storage/tables/{table_id}/import-async]

### Import data [POST]
The method of asynchronous importing should be used for larger imports (everything with 100 lines and more).
The import request is created and added to a queue; the job resource url for status polling is returned.
Asynchronous imports requested on the same table will be serialized.

The actual data must be provided in one of the following attributes: 

- **dataUrl**, 
- **dataFileId**,
- **snapshotId**, 
- **dataWorkspaceId** and **dataTableName**

An imported file can be sliced into multiple chunks; the conditions described in [File Uploads](#reference/files) must be satisfied.
The CSV file can be raw or gzipped. Gzipped files must have the extension `.gz`. A typical asynchronous import negotiation consists of these steps:

1. Upload a CSV file using [File Upload](#reference/files).
2. Submit an [asynchronous import request](#reference/tables/load-data-asynchronously/imports-data) with `dataFileId` set to the File Id returned in the previous step.
3. Poll job resource returned in the previous step until the `status` is `success` or `error`.

Further information can be found in the [Developers Documentation](https://developers.keboola.com/integrate/storage/api/import-export/).

+ Parameters
    + table_id (required) - Table Id
    
+ Attributes    
    + dataUrl (optional) - Publicly accessible url with a CSV file to import
    + dataFileId (optional) - Id of the file stored in [File Uploads](#reference/files); all gzipped and sliced files are supported.
    + snapshotId (optional) - Id of a table snapshot - a table will be created from the snapshot.
    + dataWorkspaceId (optional) - Load from the table [workspace](#reference/workspaces). Use with the **dataTableName** attribute.
    + dataTableName (optional) - Load from the table in the [workspace](#reference/workspaces).
    + incremental (optional, number) - If incremental is set to 0, the target table is truncated before each import.
        Default: 0
    + delimiter (optional) - Field delimiter used in the CSV file. The default value is ','.  Use '\t' or type the tab char for tabulator.
    + enclosure (optional) - Field enclosure used in the CSV file. The default value is '"'. (Note: you can specify either `enclosure` or `escapedBy` parameter, not both.)
    + escapedBy (optional) - Escape character used in the CSV file. The default value is an empty value - no escape character is used. (Note: you can specify either `enclosure` or `escapedBy` parameter, not both.)

## Unload Data [/v2/storage/tables/{table_id}/export]
### Export table into CSV [GET]

This method is **DEPRECATED**, please use the [asynchronous version](#reference/tables/unload-data-asynchronously) of this method.

#### HTTP Compression

To enable compression of API response traffic, please include the following HTTP header with the API request: `Accept-encoding: gzip`.

#### Error Handling

The moment the streaming connection is established, the HTTP 200 response code is returned and data are streamed row by row.
When an error occurs and data cannot be streamed any more, a special row is returned to stream `KBC_INTERNAL_ERROR`.
When you receive this message, please run the export again; these errors are very rare.

## Unload Data Asynchronously [/v2/storage/tables/{table_id}/export-async]

### Asynchronous Export [POST]
Exports data into File Storage. The Id of the created file is returned.
This task is asynchronous; Id of the created file is stored in the `results` of the created job when the job is finished.

#### Rows filtering
Exported rows can be filtered by a single filter. Examples of filtering by `userId` column:

- `whereColumn=UserId&whereValues[]=23423` - Filters by single values of one column.
- `whereColumn=UserId&whereValues[]=23423&whereValues[]=123` - Filters by multiple values of one column.
- `whereColumn=UserId&whereValues[]=23423&whereOperator=ne` - Uses a different comparison operator.

Only [Indexed columns](#reference/tables/create-column-index/mark-column-as-indexed) can be used in the `whereColumn` parameter.
The comparison operator essentially behaves like the [SQL IN](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_in.asp) (and NOT IN) operator. That is, the 
`eq` value matches if any `whereValues` match, and the `new` value matches if none `whereValues` match.

#### Caching
Asynchronous exports support internal caching. When the export file for a certain table 
export parameters was created and there were no changes in the table data since, the
previous cached file will be returned.

#### Job results

The response contains a link to job results. Once the job is finished, the job result
will show information about the created file and caching:

```
    {
        "file": {
            "id": 234
        },
        "cacheHit": false
    }
```    

+ Parameters
    + table_id (required) - Table Id

+ Attributes
    + limit (optional, number) - Limit the number of returned rows.
    + days (optional, number) - **DEPRECATED will be removed in the future.** It returns rows created or updated in the last X days.
    + format (optional, enum[string]) - File format
        + Members
            + rfc - According to [RFC](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt).
            + escaped - Delimited by a comma, enclosed by a double quote, special characters (e.g. new line, tab) escaped by a backslash. Each row in the CSV file is equal to one row in Storage.
            + raw - Delimited by tab, without an enclosure, special characters (e.g. new line, tab)  escaped by a backslash. Each row in the CSV file is equal to one row in Storage.
        + Default: rfc
    + changedSince (optional) - Filtering by import date - timestamp of import is stored within each row. Both until and since values can be a unix timestamp or any date accepted by [strtotime](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php).
    + changedUntil (optional) - Filtering by import date - timestamp of import is stored within each row. Both until and since values can be a unix timestamp or any date accepted by [strtotime](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php).
        Examples: `-2 days`, `1360138863`, `2013-02-12T15:19:21+00:00`
    + columns (optional) - Comma separated list of columns to export; by default all columns are exported.
    + whereColumn (optional) - Column for exporting only matching rows; see more in the rows filtering section.

# Group Table Aliases
[Aliases](https://help.keboola.com/storage/tables/) behave like database Views. Alias tables are read-only. 
Aliases cannot be chained and can be applied only between buckets with the same backend.

Rows present in an alias table can be filtered by a simple condition similar to 
[table export filtering](#reference/tables/unload-data-asynchronously/asynchronous-export).
The filter parameter `aliasFilter` must be set during an alias table creation or later to enable filtering:

* **column** - Filtered by column name
* **operator** - Filter operator: `eq`, `ne`
* **values[]** - One or more filter values

There are some limitations:
* Filtering is enabled only on indexed tables
* Index on a filtered column of the source table cannot be removed

#### Alias table columns
By default, the alias columns are automatically synced with the source table. You can disable this behaviour
by setting up `aliasColumnsAutosync` to `false` and setting up list of columns by `aliasColumns` parameter.
Later you can modify the alias columns by the table columns methods.
When turning `aliasColumnsAutoSync` back on, the columns will be immediately synced with the source table.

# Group Table Snapshotting
Table data and metadata (attributes, column settings) can be persisted by creating a snapshot. 
When a snapshot is created you can use it to restore the table back to the snapshotted state.
During the restoration process, the data can be applied to the original table or they can be restored
into a new table.

## Create or List Snapshots [/v2/storage/tables/{table_id}/snapshots]

### Create Table Snapshot [POST]

## Rollback Snapshot [/v2/storage/tables/{table_id}/rollback]

### Rollback Table From Snapshot [POST]
This operation allows reverting a table to a state stored in the snapshot. Table `data`, `medatadata` and `attributes` are 
returned into a state stored in the specified snapshot. Rollback is disabled if there is an alias on the table and 
that alias (or the alias filter) contains columns which are not present in the snapshot. This request 
is [asynchronous](#introduction/synchronous-and-asynchronous-calls).

+ Parameters
    + table_id (required) - Id of the table whose content will be overwritten

+ Attributes
    + snapshotId (required, number) - Id of the snapshot

# Group Events
Virtually every interaction of the client (an API call) creates an Event. Apart from that, external events may
also be added via an API. Events are available for 6 months from their creation.
You can access all events created on an account. 

Events can be filtered by various filters:
- `sinceId`, `maxId` - Events newer or older than the passed id
- `component` - Component name
- `configurationId` - Configuration id
- `runId` - Run id
- `q` - Advanced search using a query string. [Query string syntax](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax)

The events pagination uses two parameters:
- `limit` - Number of returned events. The default value: 100
- `offset` - Pagination offset

# Group Jobs
Jobs are objects that manage asynchronous tasks, these are all potentially long-running actions such as 
loading table data, snapshotting, table structure modifications. Jobs are created by actions on target 
resources, e.g., an [Asynchronous import request](#reference/tables/load-data-asynchronously/import-data) creates 
a table import job. For each new job, the Id and URL of the job is returned. 

When working with jobs, follow these steps:
1. **Start the job** - Job resource is created and a URL for polling is returned.
2. **Poll job status** - Poll the job URL in a loop until the job `status` is set to `success` or `error`.
3. **Check the results** - When the job is finished, the `results` field will contain the actual result of the original request.

Available Statuses:
- `waiting` - The job is in the queue and is waiting for execution.
- `processing` - The job is being processed by a worker.
- `success` - The job is done with a success.
- `error` - The job is done with an error.

# Group Files
File Storage is used for storing arbitrary files. This is used for data imported into tables and data exported
from tables. Additionally, the File storage can be used for data backup and exchange between project participants.

File Storage is heavily used for data exchange between Storage API and other components, import backups, etc.
This kind of data is not kept forever. By default, all files are stored for **6 months**. They can be stored permanently by 
using the `isPermanent` parameter. Files can also be tagged to categorize file uploads. When the `X-KBC-RunId` header is 
provided, it is stored as the file `runId`.

Internally, all files are stored encrypted on [Amazon S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Welcome.html) 
and are private. When you access the file through the API, a URL with one hour expiration is generated. If you require 
a permanent URL, you can set the file as `public`.  

Large files may be split into slices (chunks). A sliced file must have the `sliced` parameter set to `true`. In that case 
the S3 key points to a **manifest file**. The manifest file contains the actual list of uploaded chunks. When uploading a sliced
file, you have to use the provided key as a prefix for chunks and generate the manifest file with the list of uploaded chunks.
When a CSV file is imported into Storage Tables, there is no difference between a normal and a sliced file.

**Example:**

Assume that the [upload method](#reference/files/upload-file/) returns the following S3 key `exp-180/11/files/2014/02/25/11085.import`. 
Then you can upload e.g. these files:
- exp-180/11/files/2014/02/25/11085.import_001
- exp-180/11/files/2014/02/25/11085.import_002
- exp-180/11/files/2014/02/25/11085.import_003

Then create the following manifest file:
```
{
  "entries": [
    {"url":"s3://kbc-sapi-files-devel/exp-180/11/files/2014/02/25/11085.import_001"},
    {"url":"s3://kbc-sapi-files-devel/exp-180/11/files/2014/02/25/11085.import_002"},
    {"url":"s3://kbc-sapi-files-devel/exp-180/11/files/2014/02/25/11085.import_003"}
  ]
}
```

And then, upload that manifest file to the key `exp-180/11/files/2014/02/25/11085.import_manifest`. See our 
[Developers documentation](https://developers.keboola.com/integrate/storage/api/import-export/#working-with-sliced-files)
for a more detailed guide.

## Upload File [/v2/storage/files/prepare]
### Create File Resource [POST]
This method allows you to upload a file to KBC File Storage. The upload should be done in two steps:
1. Create a new file resource (use this API call).
2. Use the provided credentials to actually upload the file data to the Amazon S3 storage.

The credentials are generated either as standard *AWS credentials* (`federationToken` set to true) or for an HTTP *form submission* 
(`federationToken` set to false). We recommend using the federation token and any of the many S3 clients or libraries to 
upload the files. The *form submission* method is less reliable and does not work in all regions (e.g. eu-central-1, ap-northeast-2).
For a more detailed guide on the file upload, see the corresponding part of the 
[Developers documentation](https://developers.keboola.com/integrate/storage/api/import-export/#manually-uploading-a-file).

# Group Component Configurations
Component Configuration represents specific settings of a 
[registered Component](http://docs.test12301.apiary.io/#reference/miscellaneous/api-index/component-list) 
in a project. This is a utility resource available only for master tokens and tokens with the `canManageBuckets` permission.
Configurations may include *Configuration Rows* if they are composed of multiple objects. Configuration rows are 
used in case parts of the configuration are supposed to be updated independently.
Configurations are automatically versioned. Configuration Rows are versioned separately. The `configuration` and 
`rows.configuration` fields can contain arbitrary objects. The content and interpretation of those fields is fully 
defined by the component.

## List Components [/v2/storage/components?include={include}&componentType={componentType}&isDeleted={isDeleted}]

### Delete Configuration [DELETE]
Deletes a configuration. When a configuration is deleted, it is only marked as deleted and remains still available in the system.
You can [list deleted](#reference/component-configurations/component-configs/list-configs) configurations, or 
[restore deleted](#reference/component-configurations/manage-configs/restore-deleted-config) configurations.
Other operations with deleted configurations are restricted.

Calling this API call on a deleted configuration will remove it permanently. I.e. to permanently remove a configuration 
you have to delete it twice (call twice this API resource).
